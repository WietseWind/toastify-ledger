# Toastify Ledger

Add a RegularKey to a mnemonic XRP wallet (eg. Ledger Nano) to use the account with a Family Seed (secret) in all available XRP wallets / tools / decentralized exchanges.

# Why Toastify your Ledger

If you have a wallet with a mnemonic passphrase (normally 24 words) you'll probably use the Ledger application to send your XRP. The Ledger application doesn't allow you to send any other kinds of transactions. This means you can't set a Trust Line (to claim tokens, like [ALV](https://allvor.org/)) or use your wallet in another XRP app (like [ToastWallet](https://toastwallet.com/)).

With this tool you can assign a Regular Key to your existing wallet. This means a regular secret key (family seed, `sXXXXXXX...XXXXXXX`) will be generated and **added** to your existing account (wallet). After this, you can use both the Ledger software and any other XRP tool. By adding your Ledger wallet to [ToastWallet](https://toastwallet.com/) or using [The World Exchange](https://www.theworldexchange.net/)  using the Regular Key this tool generated for you, you can set Trust Lines, claim tokens, etc.

# You will still be able to use your Ledger

Using this tool will NOT disable your existing key, so your existing mnemonic wallet and the Ledger client WILL STILL WORK, the tool will just ADD A SECOND key that can sign transactions for your account. This second key is a family seed (secret), with the sXXXXXX... formatting that can be used in Toast Wallet and other XRPL tools.
